# TicTacToe-w-OOP-Python
Inspired by programmer Kylie, who has kindly made her code accessible to gain knowledge from.

## About the Program
This tic tac toe program lets you compete against the AI, which is most of the time unbeatable. The algorithm used is the minimax algorithm.

## The Minimax Algorithm
1. The maximiser step: when the AI decides to make a move, it looks through all possible moves, in advance. Then assigns a score to all moves. It then filters out all the weaker moves and selects the best move (the move with the highest score).

2. Then, the minimiser step: the AI now predicts that the human player will choose the move that is most disadvantageous for the AI. (chooses the lowest score).

3. The maximiser step again: the AI will, from all the disadvantageous moves it predicted, will predict all possible moves, and chooses the best move (highest score).

4. This cycle keeps flipping around.
